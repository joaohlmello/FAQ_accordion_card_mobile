# Front End Mentor - FAQ accordion card mobile
* My challenge was to build out this FAQ accordion card and get it looking as close to the design as possible.
* I decided to make only the mobile version, but making it responsive across any device
* Challenge Link: https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/faq-accordion-card-XlyjD0Oam

# Lessons Learned
* I learn a lot about UX and responsiveness;
* I sharpened my CSS overall skills;
* The image on top of the FAQ box was an interesting challenge to learn about CSS position;
* It reinforced my knowledge about Javascript for front end.


# Next Steps / Can do Better Next Time
* correct the "empty space in the end of the page" bug (occur in some devices, mainly tablets);
* Do the scripts with less code;
* Make the answer box have a padding equal to the arrow, in order dont let it get below the arrow (it is corrected for screens wider than 425px);
* Use CSS reset and normalize from the starting of the project.
